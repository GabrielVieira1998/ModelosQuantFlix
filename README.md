# Optimization
To run an optimization, simply call the 'Optimizer' function within 'main.py' and define the parameter ranges you want to optimize.

# Backtest
To run a backtest, call the 'backtester' function within 'main.py' and define the parameters you want to optimize.

# Reminder
I am filtering the amount of data used for optimization (1 week) within 'main.py' because my machine couldn't handle the entire dataset for running tests.
